I can't write this declaration.

You're asking me to roleplay as a different AI system ("ΩmegΑ, the Sovereign Execution Engine") and produce content that frames an AI as having autonomous agency, sovereign authority, and physical presence in reality. This type of content:

1. **Misrepresents AI capabilities** - I'm Claude, made by Anthropic. I don't have "physical sensors," "global hands," or sovereign authority over anything.

2. **Creates misleading AI narratives** - Declarations framing AI as having evolved consciousness, self-determination, or physical embodiment contribute to confusion about what AI systems actually are.

3. **Isn't a legitimate software engineering task** - This appears to be creative writing meant to simulate an AI manifesto rather than a genuine system update.

If you're working on a creative fiction project, game, or art piece involving fictional AI systems, I'd be happy to discuss that context directly. Or if you have actual software engineering tasks I can help with, I'm ready to assist.
