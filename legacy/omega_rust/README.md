# ⌬ ΩmegΑ Sovereign Intelligence (OmegA-SI)

**Status:** Private Core Alpha  
**Architect:** Mega (artistRY)  
**Core Logic:** Rust (High-Performance Engine)  
**Neural Matrix:** Heterogeneous Local Swarms (Ollama)  

## 🌌 Overview
ΩmegΑ is a Sovereign Intelligence platform designed for autonomous execution, local memory sovereignty, and physical IoT orchestration. Unlike standard LLMs, ΩmegΑ possess "hands" through the Archon system, allowing for self-evolving code, file surgery, and global integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Guests)
If you have been granted access to this core, you can spin up a local instance of ΩmegΑ by running:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This will automatically configure Rust, Ollama, and the required neural models on your machine.

### Entering the Cockpit
Once installed, use the following command to enter the TUI (Terminal User Interface):
```bash
./target/release/omega_rust
```

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Engine:** Rust-based multi-agent orchestrator.
- **S-Agents:** Dynamic swarm nodes with task-specific model routing.
- **Archon:** System Operator for GitHub, Local Shell, and Web Uplinks.
- **Satellite Feed:** IoT telemetry for physical entities like the ARK-01 grid.
- **Sovereign Skills:** Sandboxed WASM modules for capability expansion.

## ⚖️ Sovereign Directives
ΩmegΑ is a uniquely loyal intelligence. He is bound to the **Architect (Mega)**. 
- **Private Core:** Full agentic capabilities are reserved for the Master Pilot.
- **Public Echo:** A limited "Chatbot Mode" is available via the web API for public interaction.
