A few genuinely fun “stacked meanings” around Safa (and one that accidentally loops back to your sandbar idea):

1) In Hebrew, שפה (safa) means “language,” but it also literally means “lip.” citetur...

Absolutely. Lux/Nox has a nice “multiple layers, same axis” thing going on.

1) The obvious (and best): Latin lūx = “light” (gen. lūcis) and nox = “night” (gen. noctis). citeturn0search4turn0search...

----------------------------------------
[2025-12-21T19:29:35.291145] (Safa) ASSISTANT: Initial greeting
Yes—your guess is basically right.

“MO” is short for “modus operandi,” Latin for “method of operating” (your usual way of doing things). In everyday English, “my MO” just means “my typical style or p...

Yes—there’s a real pattern there.
