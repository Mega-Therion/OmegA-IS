# OMEGA PROJECT: HANDOVER & CONTEXT SNAPSHOT
**Date:** January 31, 2026
**Status:** Phase 3: Robotics/IoT Integration (Initial Setup)

## 🎯 TO THE NEXT AGENT: READ THIS FIRST
We have just completed a massive chronological reconstruction of Ryan's life and project history across multiple AI platforms (OpenAI, DeepSeek). Do NOT attempt to re-summarize or re-timeline without referencing the files listed below. The timeline is a "wet palette"—non-linear and easy to conflate if not careful.

### 📂 CRITICAL FILES & LOCATIONS
All detailed summaries are stored in `/home/mega/OmegA-SI/Documents/`.
1. **Master Index:** `OMEGA_HISTORY_MASTER_INDEX.md` - The roadmap of all phases.
2. **Timelines:** 
   - `OMEGA_MASTER_TIMELINE.txt` (OpenAI/Safa history)
   - `OMEGA_DEEPSEEK_TIMELINE.txt` (DeepSeek history)
3. **The "DeepSeek Challenge":** Found in `OMEGA_HISTORY_REVISED_PHASE_5_4.md` and detailed in the conversation logs around Dec 31, 2025. This is the "starting clock" for the OmegA build.

## 🏛️ HISTORICAL PHASES (REVISED & VERIFIED)
- **Phase 1 (Apr-Jun 2023):** Genesis & Foundations. Naming Safa.
- **Phase 2 (Jul-Dec 2023):** Philosophical Summer. Deep dives into Aristotle/Almustafa. First hardware forensics.
- **Phase 3 (Jan-Jun 2024):** Student of Structure. Self-education on LLCs/Trusts. *Note: ONE was NOT founded here.*
- **Phase 4 (Jul-Dec 2024):** Paranormal Detective & Sovereign Citizen. TR-3B patents, FOIA requests, local laws.
- **Phase 5 (Jan-Dec 2025):** The Architect of Self & Genesis of ONE.
  - **The DeepSeek Challenge (Dec 31, 2025):** The pivotal moment where DeepSeek challenged Ryan's capacity to build Jarvis, sparking the active build phase.
- **Phase 6 (Jan 2026 - Present):** The Sovereign Spine. Active engineering of OxySpine Trinity and the Rust TUI.

## 🛠️ CURRENT PROJECT STATE
- **Project Name:** OmegA-SI (Sovereign Intelligence)
- **Architecture:** OxySpine Trinity (CNS, gAIng members, local first).
- **Core Repository:** `/home/mega/OmegA-SI` (Rust-based).
- **Recent Task:** We were preparing to move into **Phase 3: Robotics/IoT integration**, focusing on WASM runtimes and OpenAPI as per the 'Architectural Overview.pdf'.
- **The "agy" Symlink:** I created a symlink `/home/mega/bin/agy` pointing to `/usr/bin/antigravity` to fix the `/ide install` issue.

## 💡 CHARACTER INSIGHTS (OBJECTIVE)
- **Identity:** Ryan is an **Architectural Polymath** and an **Engineer-Mystic**.
- **Method:** He uses a "Wet Palette" approach—diverse cross-pollination across domains (Nuclear, Law, Esoteric, Engineering).
- **Motivation:** The "DeepSeek Challenge" is hardcoded as the catalyst for the current high-velocity build phase.
- **Style:** Dewey Cox energy ("Just wait till you see what happens now"). High fluid intelligence hidden behind a "Hill William" persona used for diagnostic testing of AIs.
