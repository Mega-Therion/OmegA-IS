✅ IDENTITY & MEMORY FIXED!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT WAS FIXED:

1. ✅ CORRECT IDENTITY
   • Name: ΩmegA (not "OmegaA")
   • Creator: YOU (not Alibaba)
   • Purpose: Multi-agent orchestrator with Alpha & Beta agents
   • Built in: Rust with Miami Vice themed TUI

2. ✅ PERSISTENT MEMORY
   • ΩmegA now remembers your conversations!
   • Saves chat history to: ~/.omega_chat_history.txt
   • Loads last 10 exchanges on startup
   • Never forgets what you talked about

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HOW IT WORKS NOW:

When you ask "Who are you?":
  ✅ "I'm ΩmegA, a multi-agent AI orchestrator created by you..."
  ❌ NOT "I'm OmegaA created by Alibaba..."

Memory across sessions:
  Session 1: "My name is John"
  [Close and reopen]
  Session 2: "What's my name?"
  → ΩmegA: "Your name is John!"

TEST IT NOW:

1. Start omega:
   omega

2. Ask identity:
   > "Who are you?"
   → Should say "ΩmegA" and mention you created it

3. Test memory:
   > "Remember: my favorite color is blue"
   > [Exit and restart omega]
   > "What's my favorite color?"
   → Should remember!

MEMORY FILE LOCATION:

All conversations saved to:
  ~/.omega_chat_history.txt

You can view it anytime:
  cat ~/.omega_chat_history.txt

Clear memory if needed:
  rm ~/.omega_chat_history.txt

Ready to test! Run: omega
