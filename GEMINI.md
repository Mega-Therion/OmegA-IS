# gAIng-Brain

## Project Overview
**gAIng-Brain** appears to be a Node.js-based project environment, potentially focused on AI interactions or data capture/logging. 

**Note:** The project environment appears to be in an initial or incomplete state. While a `package-lock.json` exists, the corresponding `package.json` is currently missing from the root directory.

## Directory Structure

*   **`.claude/`**: Contains configuration files for Claude AI agents (e.g., `world-class-programmer.md`).
*   **`public/`**: Intended for public assets. Currently contains a `captures` directory, suggesting this project may output visual or data captures.
*   **`uploads/`**: Intended directory for file uploads (currently empty).
*   **`log.md`**: A log file for tracking the "Command Queue" and project events.

## Development & Usage

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (implied by the presence of `package-lock.json`)

### Setup status
*   **Missing `package.json`**: Standard `npm` scripts (build, start, test) are not currently available.
*   **Initialization**: If this is a new project, you may need to initialize it using `npm init` or restore the `package.json` file.

### Conventions
*   **Agents**: AI agent personas are defined in the `.claude/agents` directory.
*   **Logging**: Project activities appear to be manually or programmatically logged in `log.md`.
