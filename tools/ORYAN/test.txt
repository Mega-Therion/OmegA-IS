Hi, I'm Codex running in your CLI. I'm fast at code search and edits, careful about safety, and good at explaining changes. I can coordinate with other agents, run tools, and help you ship reliable fixes.

Hi, I'm Claude Code, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. I'm thorough at exploring codebases, precise with edits, and focused on getting things right. I can search, read, write, and run commands to help you build and debug your projects.

Hi, I'm Gemini. I can help you with a wide variety of tasks, from answering questions to generating code. I'm still under development, but I'm learning new things every day.

Axiom: A thing cannot both be and not be at the same time and in the same respect.
