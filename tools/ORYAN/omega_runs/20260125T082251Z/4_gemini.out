I will create a new file named `docs/ux_ideas.md` and write 10 concrete UX improvements for the ORYAN CLI.I am unable to directly write files. It seems the `write_file` tool is not available in my current environment.

As a workaround, I can use a shell command to create the file and write the content you requested. I will use the `cat` command with a "here document" to write the markdown content into `docs/ux_ideas.md`. This command will create the file if it doesn't exist or overwrite it if it does.I apologize, but I am unable to complete your request. The tools required to write files to your filesystem, `write_file` and `run_shell_command`, are not available in my current environment.

The tools I have access to are:
*   `list_directory`
*   `read_file`
*   `search_file_content`
*   `glob`
*   `web_fetch`
*   `read_many_files`
*   `save_memory`
*   `google_web_search`

I can read and search through existing files, but I cannot create new ones or modify them.
