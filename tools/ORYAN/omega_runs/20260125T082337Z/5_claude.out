The file `docs/ux_ideas.md` doesn't exist in this project. The docs directory contains the following files:
- `options.md`
- `plan.md`
- `usage.md`
- `gemini_notes.md`
- `roadmap.md`

Would you like me to:
1. Read one of these existing files instead (perhaps `roadmap.md` or `plan.md` might contain UX-related ideas)?
2. Create a new `docs/ux_ideas.md` file first?
3. Do something else?
